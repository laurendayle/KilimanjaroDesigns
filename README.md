## Description
A modern, client-facing, retail web-portal designed to improve the user experience and increase revenue. The page consists of 4 main components, including the **Product Overview** section, **Related Items** section,  **Questions and Answers** section, and **Ratings and Reviews**.

During this project, I collaborated with a team of 3 other engineers and was personally responsible for designing the **Ratings and Reviews** section. In this section, the users are able to view and submit reviews for the currently selected product. Additionally, individual reviews can be reported as "Helpful" or reported for inappropriate content. I implemented search and filter functionality, in which users can either search by keyword or click on the star breakdown to filter the reviews by star ratings. Additionally, users can filter reviews by "Helpfulness", "Relevance" and "Newest". Each filter is additive.
